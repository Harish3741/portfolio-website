// Put the files in img/<wing>/ and reference them by path. A path with no file
// behind it draws a dashed "photo goes here" slot rather than a broken image,
// so you can commit the path now and the picture later. `image: null` — the
// key with nothing in it — draws that same slot deliberately.

// THE BOARDROOM
//
// The Projects wing is a boardroom rather than a gallery: three figures round a
// table, and the table itself is what opens the wing's work.
//
// The figures are scenery. They carried a name, a role and a greeting once, for
// a version where you pressed E on a person to see their project — that never
// shipped, and the fields sat unread in the content file and in the published
// page for months afterwards. What is left is what is actually drawn.
//
// Three is the number the room is built for. Fewer and a place at the table
// stands empty; more and they queue up along the wall.
//
// `hair` is 'short' or 'long', and `palette` recolours hair, skin, shirt and
// trousers — between them, three people who don't look like triplets.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RÉSUMÉ AND THE RULES
//
// Two things you can read in the atrium: the sheet of paper on the wall above
// the compass, and the book lying open on the lectern below it. Both take the
// same fields as a project entry, so `highlights`, `tech` and `links` all work.
//
// For the résumé, `links` is where the PDF goes — a file next to the page
// ('resume.pdf'), a data URI, or a link to wherever it already lives.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  // button label, so it stays; everything below it is Harish's to write.

  // they render in that order — `links` is where a PDF goes when there is one.

// THE SCREENING ROOM
//
// The About Me wing is fitted out as a small cinema. Two things in it:
//
//   the person by the door  — press E and they give the summary below, which
//                             is just the About Me wing's entries above.
//   the chair               — sit in it and the camera pans to the screen and
//                             plays `video`.
//
// `video` takes any URL a browser can play: a file next to the page
// ('media/intro.mp4'), a data URI, or an absolute URL. Leave it null and the
// screen stays dark with a note instead — nothing breaks.
//
// `palette` is the character. Swap the hex values to change hair, skin and
// clothes; the sprite itself doesn't need touching.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
